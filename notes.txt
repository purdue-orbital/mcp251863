Table 4-1 (registers)

page 70:
	1.  The frequency of SCK has to be less than or equal to 85% of half the frequency of SYSCLK.
		This ensures that the synchronization between SCK and SYSCLK works correctly.
	2.  In order to minimize the Sleep current, the SDO pin of the MCP251863 device must not be
		left floating while the device is in Sleep mode. This can be achieved by enabling a
		pull-up or pull-down resistor inside the MCU on the pin that is connected to the SDO pin,
		while the MCP251863 device is in Sleep mode.
